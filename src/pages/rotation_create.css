/* This width is:
 * - 1em for each character in the number
 * - 1em extra for a stepper inserted by the browser (TODO:
 *   /eventually/, it might become possible to find out how wide this
 *   spinner actually is, at which point we can use as little extra
 *   padding as possible)
 * - 12px of horizontal padding, added by .rotation-series-part-inputs > input (see below)
 * If things were different, we could use box-sizing: content-box and not have
 * to worry about compensating for the padding; unfortunately the spinner is
 * counted as "content", so we'd have to add on an extra em, and Bootstrap
 * assumes box-sizing: border-box anyway.
